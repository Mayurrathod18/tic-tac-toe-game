# TIC-TAC-TOE-game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created using the Python programming language. It allows two players to play against each other on the same device. Both players can enter their names and choose whether they want to play as 'X' or 'O'. The game board updates after each turn, and it announces the winner or a draw at the end.

This was my first Python project while learning the basics of programming. The purpose was to apply fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, and functions in a fun and interactive way.
